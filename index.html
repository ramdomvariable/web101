To obtain a challenging position as a CFD Engineer, utilizing my skills in numerical modeling and simulations to contribute to the design and optimization of fluid systems.
EXPERIENCE
APRIL 2021 – TO PRESENT (4 MONTHS INTERN & 1 YEAR 8 MONTHS SIMULATION ENGINEER)
SIMULATION ENGINEER, CADFEM INDIA PVT LTD 
•	Understanding of project, Client requirement and Project scope
•	Building a model for project includes Geometry preparation, Meshing Setup
•	Post-processing & Reporting the required information as per requirement along with contour & vector plots, streamlines, tabular data etc.
•	Suggestions/recommendations to improve the performance of a computation model depending on simulation results as part of product development.

Projects
Flow and Thermal analysis of Eye Surgical equipment
•	Client- Alcon, USA
•	Task involved: Geometry simplification in Ansys Space claim, for meshing and solving
Ansys Icepak is used. Model was involving various Heat Sources, PCBs, Fans, Filters.
Airflow behavior is analyzed. For modelling PCB ECAD data was used. PCB were mesh refined to get desire grid density. Based on velocity and temperature plots effectiveness of Cooling was studied. Based on Temperature at important areas improvements were 
Suggested.

Conjugate Heat Transfer analysis of Submerged Pump
•	Client- Grundfos, Hungry
•	Task involved: Geometry simplification in Ansys Space claim, Meshing was done using the
Fluent meshing, for solving fluent was used. Two different pumps were compared
based on temperature. Multiple reference frame (MRF) approach used to model the rotary part. Steady state CFD analysis was performed to understand the temperature
distribution on two pumps. 

Flow analysis of Nozzle for gas purging in Furnace
•	Client- Tata Steel, India
•	Task involved: CAD preparation in Ansys Space claim, Fluent mesher was used for meshing, Ansys Fluent is used for solving. Higher pressure gas was purged into the blast furnace, to remove the dust particle on the lens. Analysis was done on different nozzle designs to identify better performing one.

Flow and Thermal analysis of Eye Optics Instrument
•	Client- Alcon, USA
•	Task involved: Geometry simplification in Ansys Space claim, For meshing and solving
Ansys Icepak is used. Model was involving various Heat Sources, PCBs, Fans, Blowers, Filters. Optimization of outlet vent was done in order to achieve required temperatures
On some critical areas.

Flow and Thermal Analysis of Gateway
•	Client- Utthunga, India
•	Task involved: CAD simplification in Ansys Space claim, Meshing and Solving was performed in Ansys Icepak. Model was consisting of Many PCBs and its component, Heat Sinks, Heat Spreader etc. ECAD data was used to model the PCBs and Network 2R
Model is used to model the Heat source.

Thermal Analysis of PCB to validate results with Benchtop Test
•	Client- Alcon, USA
•	Task involved: Ansys Icepak was used for this purpose. Two resistor model was used to model the Heat source on the PCB. ECAD Data was used to model the trace layers on the 
PCB.
